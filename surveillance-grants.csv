HOWEVER, MOST STATES ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES AND INITIATIVES THAT INDIRECTLY ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASES, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT PART OF A UNIFIED PLAN.   PUBLIC HEALTH 3.0 RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR A STRONG, DIVERSE WORKFORCE CAPABLE OF WORKING IN STRUCTURED COALITIONS, LEVERAGING ACTIONABLE DATA, AND COMMUNICATING INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL HEALTH SECTOR. HOWEVER, PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE ASSESSMENTS HAVE IDENTIFIED GAPS IN STRATEGIC SKILLS AND THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE TRAINING TO DEVELOPMENT THEM.   PURPOSE AND APPROACH: THE PURPOSE OF OUR APPLICATION IS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF CHRONIC DISEASE SPECIALISTS (CDSS). CDSS ARE DEFINED AS PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WORKING ON CHRONIC DISEASE INCLUDING CHRONIC DISEASE DIRECTORS, DIRECTORS OF HEALTH PROMOTION, CHRONIC DISEASE PROGRAM PRACTITIONERS, ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS, AND OTHERS, TO PLAN, COORDINATE, IMPLEMENT, AND ASSESS EFFECTIVE CHRONIC DISEASE INITIATIVES, WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITIES AND OTHER SECTORS. PHI HAS SELECTED CATEGORY B: WORKFORCE SEGMENTS FOR STRATEGY 1 ACTIVITIES. WE PROPOSE TO IMPROVE PLANNING AND DELIVERY OF CHRONIC DISEASE SERVICES IN GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THE CURRENT CDS WORKFORCE. PHI WILL UTILIZE: 1) FOCUSED COHORTS, WHICH PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTENSIVE LEARNING IN SMALL GROUPS; AND 2) ACCESS TO NATIONAL NETWORKS AND NATIONAL WEBINAR AND SPEAKER SERIES. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO REACH A BROADER NATIONAL AUDIENCE AND ADDRESS THE CAPACITY-BUILDING ASSISTANCE (CBA) NEEDS OF THE POPULATION OF FOCUS MORE WIDELY.   OUTCOMES: DURING THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE, PHI WILL IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES TO ACHIEVE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF AND ACCESS TO CBA SERVICES AND PRODUCTS; ENHANCED SKILL AND ABILITY TO SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING TOWARD APPLYING RECOMMENDED PROCESSES, POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND PRACTICES; AND INCREASED IMPLEMENTATION AND SHARING OF RECOMMENDED PROCESSES, POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND PRACTICES.    BY THE END OF YEAR 1, PHI WILL HAVE BUILT THE CAPACITY OF 2 COHORTS OF 4 CDS (WITH UP TO 3-4 SUPPORTING TEAM MEMBERS) REPRESENTING UP TO 8 DISTINCT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEMONSTRATE IMPROVED CAPACITY TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT CD PROGRAMS.    STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES: TO ACHIEVE THIS OUTCOME OF CDS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, PHI DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A NATIONAL CHRONIC DISEASE CAPACITY BUILDING INITIATIVE (CDCBI) PROGRAM TO SUPPORT CDC IN STRENGTHENING NATIONAL CAPACITY TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE. PHI’S STRATEGY WILL BE DIVIDED INTO THREE KEY ACTIVITY AREAS:    - FOCUSED CDS COHORT TRAINING (INTENSIVE LEARNING IN SMALL GROUPS)  - SUPPORTING CDSS NATIONWIDE WITH ACCESS TO NATIONAL CHRONIC DISEASE NETWORKS, COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE, WEBINARS, AND VIRTUAL CONVERSATIONS   - EVALUATION AND IMPROVEMENT   OUR CHRONIC DISEASE EXPERIENCE AND CAPACITY: PHI HAS THE GEOGRAPHIC, PROGRAMMATIC, AND FUNCTIONAL EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO BUILD CAPACITY OF LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPROVE CHRONIC DISEASE AND PUBLIC HEALTH. CURRENTLY, PHI IMPLEMENTS 67 PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES WITH NATION AND GLOBAL REACH, ALL WORKING TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY, ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE, WELL-BEING, AND IMPROVE THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND HEALTH OF UNDERSERVED, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IN THAT TIME PERIOD, WE HAVE HELD 19 PRIME AWARDS FOR A TOTAL OF $88M+ INCLUDING MULTIPLE PROJECTS TO BUILD CHRONIC DISEASE CAPACITY. PHI’S STRONG ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL PLATFORM CREATES A FLEXIBLE, SCALABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THIS PROGRAM.  PHI’S CDCBI TEAM COMPRISES AN EXPERIENCED TEAM OF CURRENT PHI CHRONIC DISEASE SPECIALISTS AND LEARNING DESIGN PROFESSIONALS COMPLEMENTED BY EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS/PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS AND EVALUATORS.",CATEGORY B: CHRONIC DISEASE SPECIALISTS,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,M,NONPROFIT WITH 501C3 IRS STATUS (OTHER THAN AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION),C,CORRECT AN EXISTING RECORD,C,REVISION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NU38PW000031_075/,2025-09-24,2025-09-24

FIRST, WE WILL DEFINE, EXTRACT, AND VALIDATE A RETROSPECTIVE, POPULATION-LEVEL COHORT OF DIVERSE INDIVIDUALS WITH SARS-COV-2 INFECTION. THE COHORT WILL EXPAND OVER TIME, ENABLING MEASUREMENT OF INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF PCCS LONGITUDINALLY. SECOND, WE WILL RECRUIT THREE AGE-BASED COHORTS (&LT;12 YEARS, 12-17 YEARS, 18+ YEARS) TO PROSPECTIVELY TRACK INDIVIDUALS WITH RECENT SARS-COV-2 INFECTION TO MEASURE THE BURDEN AND OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PCCS. OUR MULTI-PRONGED SURVEILLANCE APPROACH WILL ENABLE MEASUREMENT OF THE CLINICAL SPECTRUM, PROGRESSION, INCIDENCE, AND PREVALENCE OF PCCS IN DIVERSE POPULATIONS. OUR WORK WILL LEVERAGE THE ROBUST HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN INDIANA THAT INCLUDES DATA EXCHANGED BETWEEN CLINICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS. IT WILL FURTHER SUPPORT THE TRAINING OF JUNIOR SCIENTISTS WHO WILL BE PART OF A FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE WITH SKILLS IN PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATICS AS WELL AS DATA SCIENCE.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,,,C,REVISION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NU58IP000004_075/,2025-06-05,2025-06-05

HOWEVER, MOST STATES ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES AND INITIATIVES THAT INDIRECTLY ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASES, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT PART OF A UNIFIED PLAN.   PUBLIC HEALTH 3.0 RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR A STRONG, DIVERSE WORKFORCE CAPABLE OF WORKING IN STRUCTURED COALITIONS, LEVERAGING ACTIONABLE DATA, AND COMMUNICATING INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL HEALTH SECTOR. HOWEVER, PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE ASSESSMENTS HAVE IDENTIFIED GAPS IN STRATEGIC SKILLS AND THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE TRAINING TO DEVELOPMENT THEM.   PURPOSE AND APPROACH: THE PURPOSE OF OUR APPLICATION IS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF CHRONIC DISEASE SPECIALISTS (CDSS). CDSS ARE DEFINED AS PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WORKING ON CHRONIC DISEASE INCLUDING CHRONIC DISEASE DIRECTORS, DIRECTORS OF HEALTH PROMOTION, CHRONIC DISEASE PROGRAM PRACTITIONERS, ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS, AND OTHERS, TO PLAN, COORDINATE, IMPLEMENT, AND ASSESS EFFECTIVE CHRONIC DISEASE INITIATIVES, WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITIES AND OTHER SECTORS. PHI HAS SELECTED CATEGORY B: WORKFORCE SEGMENTS FOR STRATEGY 1 ACTIVITIES. WE PROPOSE TO IMPROVE PLANNING AND DELIVERY OF CHRONIC DISEASE SERVICES IN GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THE CURRENT CDS WORKFORCE. PHI WILL UTILIZE: 1) FOCUSED COHORTS, WHICH PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTENSIVE LEARNING IN SMALL GROUPS; AND 2) ACCESS TO NATIONAL NETWORKS AND NATIONAL WEBINAR AND SPEAKER SERIES. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO REACH A BROADER NATIONAL AUDIENCE AND ADDRESS THE CAPACITY-BUILDING ASSISTANCE (CBA) NEEDS OF THE POPULATION OF FOCUS MORE WIDELY.   OUTCOMES: DURING THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE, PHI WILL IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES TO ACHIEVE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF AND ACCESS TO CBA SERVICES AND PRODUCTS; ENHANCED SKILL AND ABILITY TO SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING TOWARD APPLYING RECOMMENDED PROCESSES, POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND PRACTICES; AND INCREASED IMPLEMENTATION AND SHARING OF RECOMMENDED PROCESSES, POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND PRACTICES.    BY THE END OF YEAR 1, PHI WILL HAVE BUILT THE CAPACITY OF 2 COHORTS OF 4 CDS (WITH UP TO 3-4 SUPPORTING TEAM MEMBERS) REPRESENTING UP TO 8 DISTINCT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEMONSTRATE IMPROVED CAPACITY TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT CD PROGRAMS.    STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES: TO ACHIEVE THIS OUTCOME OF CDS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, PHI DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A NATIONAL CHRONIC DISEASE CAPACITY BUILDING INITIATIVE (CDCBI) PROGRAM TO SUPPORT CDC IN STRENGTHENING NATIONAL CAPACITY TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE. PHI’S STRATEGY WILL BE DIVIDED INTO THREE KEY ACTIVITY AREAS:    - FOCUSED CDS COHORT TRAINING (INTENSIVE LEARNING IN SMALL GROUPS)  - SUPPORTING CDSS NATIONWIDE WITH ACCESS TO NATIONAL CHRONIC DISEASE NETWORKS, COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE, WEBINARS, AND VIRTUAL CONVERSATIONS   - EVALUATION AND IMPROVEMENT   OUR CHRONIC DISEASE EXPERIENCE AND CAPACITY: PHI HAS THE GEOGRAPHIC, PROGRAMMATIC, AND FUNCTIONAL EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO BUILD CAPACITY OF LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPROVE CHRONIC DISEASE AND PUBLIC HEALTH. CURRENTLY, PHI IMPLEMENTS 67 PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES WITH NATION AND GLOBAL REACH, ALL WORKING TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY, ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE, WELL-BEING, AND IMPROVE THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND HEALTH OF UNDERSERVED, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IN THAT TIME PERIOD, WE HAVE HELD 19 PRIME AWARDS FOR A TOTAL OF $88M+ INCLUDING MULTIPLE PROJECTS TO BUILD CHRONIC DISEASE CAPACITY. PHI’S STRONG ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL PLATFORM CREATES A FLEXIBLE, SCALABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THIS PROGRAM.

A 2012 SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (DPHHS) FOUND THAT FEW PROVIDERS SCREEN MEDICAID-ENROLLED CHILDREN ACCORDING TO PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS, MOST PROVIDERS (94%) BELIEVE THERE IS LOW RISK OF LEAD POISONING IN THEIR AREA, AND THAT THE MOST COMMON RISK FACTOR CITED BY PROVIDERS IS THE AGE OF THE CHILD?S HOME (71%). IN 2019 AND 2020, ONLY 37 CASES OF ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS (BLL) AMONG CHILDREN < 6 YEARS WERE REPORTED TO DPHHS; DPHHS MAY NOT BE IDENTIFYING 97% OF MEDICAID-ENROLLED CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED BLL. DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING, DPHHS HAS NOT HAD AN ACTIVE LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR OVER A DECADE. FUNDING THROUGH THIS COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WILL PROVIDE DPHHS THE RESOURCES TO ESTABLISH A MONTANA CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION AND SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM (CLPPSP) WHICH WILL CONSIST OF TWO STAFF, A PROGRAM COORDINATOR AND AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST, WITH AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF $300,000. THE MONTANA CLPPSP WILL USE OUR CHILDHOOD BLOOD LEAD SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO COLLECT AND REPORT DATA TO THE CDC TO SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING INTERMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM OUTCOMES: 1) IMPROVED BLOOD LEAD TESTING AND REPORTING RATES FOR CHILDREN  LESS THAN 6 YEARS OF AGE AT RISK FOR LEAD EXPOSURE; 2) IMPROVED THE USE OF SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM DATA TO CAPTURE MISSING DATA ON CHILD DEMOGRAPHIC AND FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION; 3) DECREASED DISPARITIES IN BLOOD LEAD LEVELS BY RACE/ETHNICITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS; AND 4)IMPROVED RATES OF CHILDREN LESS THAN 6 YEARS OF AGE WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS LINKED TO RECOMMENDED SERVICES.THE MONTANA CLPPSP WILL ENGAGE IN SECONDARY PREVENTION ACTIVITIES OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING TO ENSURE BLOOD LEAD TESTING, ENHANCE BLOOD LEAD SURVEILLANCE AND REPORTING, AND IMPROVE LINKAGES TO RECOMMENDED SERVICES. KEY TASKS DPHHS AIMS TO ACCOMPLISH IN PROJECT YEAR 1 INCLUDE: RECRUIT AND HIRE AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST, CONVENING A LEAD ADVISORY COMMITTEE, PUBLISH A CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION SCREENING AND TESTING STRATEGIC PLAN, UPDATE REPORTABLE CONDITIONS RULES TO INCLUDE REPORTS OF ALL BLOOD LEAD TEST RESULTS, ENSURE THAT DPHHS?S SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM HAS THE ABILITY TO COLLECT AND TRACK FOLLOW-UP AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION, CONTRACT WITH SELECT LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO ENHANCE ACTIVITIES FOR LEAD POISONING PREVENTION BY COORDINATING WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS AND CONNECT CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS TO RECOMMENDED MEDICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL SERVICES.

HOWEVER, MOST STATES ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES AND INITIATIVES THAT INDIRECTLY ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASES, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT PART OF A UNIFIED PLAN.   PUBLIC HEALTH 3.0 RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR A STRONG, DIVERSE WORKFORCE CAPABLE OF WORKING IN STRUCTURED COALITIONS, LEVERAGING ACTIONABLE DATA, AND COMMUNICATING INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL HEALTH SECTOR. HOWEVER, PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE ASSESSMENTS HAVE IDENTIFIED GAPS IN STRATEGIC SKILLS AND THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE TRAINING TO DEVELOPMENT THEM.   PURPOSE AND APPROACH: THE PURPOSE OF OUR APPLICATION IS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF CHRONIC DISEASE SPECIALISTS (CDSS). CDSS ARE DEFINED AS PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WORKING ON CHRONIC DISEASE INCLUDING CHRONIC DISEASE DIRECTORS, DIRECTORS OF HEALTH PROMOTION, CHRONIC DISEASE PROGRAM PRACTITIONERS, ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS, AND OTHERS, TO PLAN, COORDINATE, IMPLEMENT, AND ASSESS EFFECTIVE CHRONIC DISEASE INITIATIVES, WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITIES AND OTHER SECTORS. PHI HAS SELECTED CATEGORY B: WORKFORCE SEGMENTS FOR STRATEGY 1 ACTIVITIES. WE PROPOSE TO IMPROVE PLANNING AND DELIVERY OF CHRONIC DISEASE SERVICES IN GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THE CURRENT CDS WORKFORCE. PHI WILL UTILIZE: 1) FOCUSED COHORTS, WHICH PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTENSIVE LEARNING IN SMALL GROUPS; AND 2) ACCESS TO NATIONAL NETWORKS AND NATIONAL WEBINAR AND SPEAKER SERIES. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO REACH A BROADER NATIONAL AUDIENCE AND ADDRESS THE CAPACITY-BUILDING ASSISTANCE (CBA) NEEDS OF THE POPULATION OF FOCUS MORE WIDELY.   OUTCOMES: DURING THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE, PHI WILL IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES TO ACHIEVE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF AND ACCESS TO CBA SERVICES AND PRODUCTS; ENHANCED SKILL AND ABILITY TO SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING TOWARD APPLYING RECOMMENDED PROCESSES, POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND PRACTICES; AND INCREASED IMPLEMENTATION AND SHARING OF RECOMMENDED PROCESSES, POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND PRACTICES.    BY THE END OF YEAR 1, PHI WILL HAVE BUILT THE CAPACITY OF 2 COHORTS OF 4 CDS (WITH UP TO 3-4 SUPPORTING TEAM MEMBERS) REPRESENTING UP TO 8 DISTINCT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEMONSTRATE IMPROVED CAPACITY TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT CD PROGRAMS.    STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES: TO ACHIEVE THIS OUTCOME OF CDS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, PHI DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A NATIONAL CHRONIC DISEASE CAPACITY BUILDING INITIATIVE (CDCBI) PROGRAM TO SUPPORT CDC IN STRENGTHENING NATIONAL CAPACITY TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE. PHI’S STRATEGY WILL BE DIVIDED INTO THREE KEY ACTIVITY AREAS:    - FOCUSED CDS COHORT TRAINING (INTENSIVE LEARNING IN SMALL GROUPS)  - SUPPORTING CDSS NATIONWIDE WITH ACCESS TO NATIONAL CHRONIC DISEASE NETWORKS, COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE, WEBINARS, AND VIRTUAL CONVERSATIONS   - EVALUATION AND IMPROVEMENT   OUR CHRONIC DISEASE EXPERIENCE AND CAPACITY: PHI HAS THE GEOGRAPHIC, PROGRAMMATIC, AND FUNCTIONAL EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO BUILD CAPACITY OF LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPROVE CHRONIC DISEASE AND PUBLIC HEALTH. CURRENTLY, PHI IMPLEMENTS 67 PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES WITH NATION AND GLOBAL REACH, ALL WORKING TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY, ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE, WELL-BEING, AND IMPROVE THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND HEALTH OF UNDERSERVED, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IN THAT TIME PERIOD, WE HAVE HELD 19 PRIME AWARDS FOR A TOTAL OF $88M+ INCLUDING MULTIPLE PROJECTS TO BUILD CHRONIC DISEASE CAPACITY. PHI’S STRONG ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL PLATFORM CREATES A FLEXIBLE, SCALABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THIS PROGRAM.
